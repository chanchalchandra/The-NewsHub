                    <p class="card-description">A team of four students from IIIT Naya Raipur—Divyansh Kushwaha, Deepanshu Pratik, Shivanshu Prajapati—under the guidance of Dr. Shrivishal Tripathi, has been granted a patent for developing a novel system to measure body temperature using a USB thermal camera attached to a smartphone. This innovation leverages machine learning and image processing to provide real-time temperature readings, even for groups.

                        Developed in response to the limitations of traditional methods used during COVID-19, this solution offers a cost-effective, scalable, and safe alternative for high-traffic areas like airports, hospitals, and schools. The technology has demonstrated accuracy and reliability and is considered a breakthrough in public health screening.</p>
